https://dic.pixiv.net/en/a/Kaguya%20Shinomiya,Kaguya Shinomiya is... - pixiv Encyclopedia,,"Kaguya Shinomiya is the titular protagonist of the Kaguya-Sama: Love is War series. She was student at Shuchi'in Academy, a member of the Archery Club, and the Vice President of the 67th and 68th Student Council.","Kaguya was a very cold and rational individual, but she slowly changed after joining the student council. During her earlier days in council, she considered Miyuki Shirogane as one she would be fine to be in a relationship with if, and only if, he confesses first, thus she constantly plays mind games in trying to get him to confess. Later in the series, her actions imply that she is starting to accept her feelings of liking Miyuki, but won't openly admit it. Due to being part of a wealthy and important family, Kaguya is sometimes seen arrogant and is very confident about her intelligence and incredible skills. However this only her image that portates outside. Deep down she always is with an inmmense pressure for accomplishing her family's expectations, feels desesperate to do things her friends daily do. She doesn't consider herself a good person and as such, has a longing for true kindness that borders on obsession which she found in Miyuki. She cares about the members of the student council and considers them as treasured friends. Kaguya has a bad habit of immediately turning to money to solve her problems. In general, she tends to address people in a formal manner, and almost always uses their last names in a conversation. Because of having a very protected childhood, Kaguya rarely had interacted with people apart of Ai Hayasaka who's served her since a very young age and Kaguya considers a sister rather than a servant until she joined the student council. She also lacks of what could be considered as common knowledge or doing common things from people of her age such as going to shopping in group, watching the fireworks at night, and taking photographs with her friends. She also doesn't know much about using the internet, had no idea that websites like Twitter existed and only found out about it when Hayasaka told her. Kaguya suffers from mood swings, which is a result of her upbringing, with the various moods having their own distinct pseudo-personalities that occasionally act out mental court cases in her head, serving as a visual representation of her psyche. There is Ice Queen, taking form with a Kaguya's pre-council hairstyle and being the prosecutor of other representations. The Moron, appearing with a flower sprouting from her head and deformed to a chibi in later appearances. And finally, the Kaguya Child version takes the role of the judge. It has been shown that when Kaguya becomes sick or otherwise incapacitated, her basic human desires skyrocket as a result of her brain not being as functional as it usually is, thus making her ego fundamentally dormant while it takes over her. Chika describes this state as akin to a ""baby"" and Kaguya herself has no recollection of any events during this state. Due to her lack of sexual knowledge, she developed a rather immature sense of humor, especially regarding words related to sex such as ""wiener"" and tends to laugh hysterically when such words are uttered. Like Miyuki Shirogane, Kaguya is very popular and female students often ask her for love advices believing she has experience and has many knowledge about it. But turns out she's never had a boyfriend before, so she doesn't really know much about it but tries her best to hide that fact.","A member of Shinomiya Zaibatsu and the daughter of the Shinomiya group. A multi-talented genius who can do anything if she sets her mind to it (except, beating Miyuki Shirogane in exams). Because she has had the rules and expectations of the Shinomiya family drilled into her from a young age,  her logical side always looks for ways she can use people for her and the Shinomiya family's benefit. This causes her to be wary of all potential friends, putting them through ""trust challenges"" to determine whether she should befriend them. She has had a very protected childhood, where she has been kept from learning things that are deemed ""inappropriate"".  Other than Ai Hayasaka who has served her since childhood, she has rarely interacted with other people before she joined the student council. She is a sheltered girl resulting in her lacking several pieces of what might be considered as common knowledge. Her mother died when she was young, and she is shown to have a negative relationship with the rest of her family.","Kaguya's surname Shinomiya means ""four"" (四) (shi) and ""temple, shrine, palace"" (宮) (miya)."
