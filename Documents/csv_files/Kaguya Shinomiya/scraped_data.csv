She was student at Shuchi'in Academy, a member of the Archery Club, and the Vice President of the 67th and 68th Student Council.","Kaguya was a very cold and rational individual, but she slowly changed after joining the student council. During her earlier days in council, she considered Miyuki Shirogane as one she would be fine to be in a relationship with if, and only if, he confesses first, thus she constantly plays mind games in trying to get him to confess. Later in the series, her actions imply that she is starting to accept her feelings of liking Miyuki, but won't openly admit it.","A member of Shinomiya Zaibatsu and the daughter of the Shinomiya group. A multi-talented genius who can do anything if she sets her mind to it (except, beating Miyuki Shirogane in exams). Because she has had the rules and expectations of the Shinomiya family drilled into her from a young age,  her logical side always looks for ways she can use people for her and the Shinomiya family's benefit. This causes her to be wary of all potential friends, putting them through ""trust challenges"" to determine whether she should befriend them. She has had a very protected childhood, where she has been kept from learning things that are deemed ""inappropriate"".","Kaguya's surname Shinomiya means ""four"" (四) (shi) and ""temple, shrine, palace"" (宮) (miya)."
