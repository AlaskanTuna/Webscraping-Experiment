# Webscraping Experiment 0.0.1

## How to run
Run the .py scripts from the repository in any IDE. 101 is hardcoded (WIP) whereas 102 has terminal interface (WIP).

## Why we created this
This is an experiment to create a program to scrape website information into useful data for research and analysis purposes.

## 101 and 102
101 is our initial proposal demo. 102 is our cutting-edge demo. Both are still WIP.
